            <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
            <p>
                Responsive web design refers to creating websites that adapt to the type of device that are being displayed on.
                Essentially, websites can be displayed on desktop monitors, tablets, phones, etc. Each of these devices will have a different screen size, resolution, and orientation (landscape vs. portrait).
                Responsive web design takes all this into account, and will determine what the best layout of the website is depending on the different attributes of the display the website is being viewed on.
            </p>

            <h2>Responsive Design & Web Technologies</h2>
            <p>
                Web Technologies make it easier to properly dynamically change the way a website looks, in response to the device it is being viewed on.
                Mainly, responsive web design became possible because of the "media query" that is possible through a websites stylesheet.
                One thing we can do with the @media css rule is determine how the website is being viewed. We can determine if the page should be optimized for viewing on a device, such as a desktop monitor or a phone screen. Or, we can determine if the web page is about to be printed, in which case we might want to display elements differently. We can also even determine if the web page is being read by a "screen reader", and optimize it by taking into consideration accessibility.
                If it is being viewed on a device, we can determine the size of the display, the orientation, and the resolution in order to optimize the web page differently.

            <h2>Building Web Apps for Different Devices</h2>
            <p>
                I've learned that in creating responsive websites, web developers have to take many things into consideration. It's important to dynamically change the website display for various displays, since you never know how someone will be accessing your website. Responsive website design greatly enhance the professional outlook of a website, and definitely is far more pleasant to use, in comparison to a fixed/ static web page.
                Users generally dislike scrolling horizontally, so it's best to avoid it if possible, and the best way to do it is by creating a responsive website.

            <h2>My Learning Experience in WEB222</h2>
            <p>
                Personally, my learning experience in WEB222 was great. Up until now, I've only been able to see my programming work displayed in a console, which is not necessarily fun to look at. However, by learning web programming through JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I've had a lot of fun learning how websites work and creating my own websites for Assignment 5 and our Final Assessment.
                Being able to see the product of my work through an actual web page was a great feeling, and I definitely look forward to WEB322 to learn more about web design.
